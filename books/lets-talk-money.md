We worry about investment the way we worry about our weight.Instead of deiting or investing being a habbit, we only think of them as a remidial measures when our weight or oue bank balance goes too hight or too low.

## Build the Money box
Our money worries usually centre around finding the best ROI.But there is a lot more to financial fitness than just investments.we need a system and not a single-shot solution.
The idea of the money box is centered around creating three different buckets/accounts- **Income account, Spend-It account and Invest-it account**(names speak for themselves) that allows yout to streamline your cashflow.
#### Rule
The rules for the money box to work are -
- As the salary hits your `Income account` you move the monthly expenditure to `Spend-it account` within 30mins or a day at max.
- Leftovers are moved to `Invest-it account`.
- use the `Income account` for all the money inflow.
- start setting up `emergency fund` from the `Invest-it` account.A `FD`,`Flexi-FD's` or `short term debt mutual funds` are some good options.
- Rule of caution never ever transfer the money from `Invest-it account` to `Spend-It account`. 
- Money corpus is not build overnight,start saving maybe with 1 per cent and then gradually increase it over time.
- getting used to the system takes time, but once set in motion bears good fruit.
#### It is okay if... 
- you have the three acount system in place that seperates your income, spending and savings.
- your saving is at least 15-20 per cent of your take home income.
- your spending is within 40 per cent of your take home income.
- your emergency funds should cover atleast 6 months living cost.
- your emergency fund sits in ultra short term or conservative hybrid mutual funds.
