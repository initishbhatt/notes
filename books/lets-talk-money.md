We worry about investment the way we worry about our weight.Instead of deiting or investing being a habbit, we only think of them as a remidial measures when our weight or oue bank balance goes too hight or too low.

## Build the Money box
Our money worries usually centre around finding the best ROI.But there is a lot more to financial fitness than just investments.we need a system and not a single-shot solution.
The idea of the money box is centered around creating three different buckets/accounts- **Income account, Spend-It account and Invest-it account**(names speak for themselves) that allows yout to streamline your cashflow.
#### Rule
The rules for the money box to work are -
- As the salary hits your `Income account` you move the monthly expenditure to `Spend-it account` within 30mins or a day at max.
- Leftovers are moved to `Invest-it account`.
- use the `Income account` for all the money inflow.
- start setting up `emergency fund` from the `Invest-it` account.A `FD`,`Flexi-FD's` or `short term debt mutual funds` are some good options.
- Rule of caution never ever transfer the money from `Invest-it account` to `Spend-It account`. 
- Money corpus is not build overnight,start saving maybe with 1 per cent and then gradually increase it over time.
- getting used to the system takes time, but once set in motion bears good fruit.
#### It is okay if... 
- you have the three acount system in place that seperates your income, spending and savings.
- your saving is at least 15-20 per cent of your take home income.
- your spending is within 40 per cent of your take home income.
- your emergency funds should cover atleast 6 months living cost.
- your emergency fund sits in ultra short term or conservative hybrid mutual funds.

## Building up the protection
The building blocks for setting up a protection are a good **Health Insurance** and a **Term plan**. Most of us view insurance as an investment instead of life cover which defeats the whole purpose of insurance.
#### Rule
- Never consider the work cover provided by employer as sufficent, if you lose job you lose out on the insurance too.
- Never buy a `ULIP` or a `traditional plan` that every RM and agent tries to lure you in. 
- When buying a health insurance always check its performance on the metric of `Price`, `benefits`, and `claim`.
#### It is okay if...
 - you have a work cover as well as a family floater, for small towns 3 to 7 lacs, 15 lacs for metro cities.
 - you have a pure term insurance plan bought online to remove agent comission cost.
 - you should have atleast eight to 10 times the annual take home incone as sum assured on the term plan.

## Understanding the jargons of investing
Often people tend to resist investment because of the lack of knowlege or a tendency to keep the liquid money for emergency.

A lot of people invest but fall prey to inefficiency, low returns & high cost due to lack of understanding investments.Unfortunately the financial sector is built in a way to keep the things difficult for a retail investor.The less you understand the more chance that you can be cheated.
